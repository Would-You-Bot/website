Discord is a great platform for hosting events and engaging with your community. Here are 10 easy and fun Discord event ideas to help you getstarted:

## 1. Game Nights

Hosting game nights is a great way to bring your community together and have some fun. You can play a variety of games, from multiplayer online games like <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us" target="_blank">Minecraft</a> to party games like <a href="https://minigamemadness.net/" target="_blank">Minigame Madness</a> that everyone can join in on. If you are looking for ways [to make your discord server more fun](/blog/how-to-make-your-discord-server-more-fun) make sure you check out post on that topic after this one! You can even organize tournaments and give out prizes to the winners. Create a dedicated voice and text channel for different games so people can join in and share their gameplay.

## 2. Trivia Tournaments

Trivia tournaments are a fun way to test your community's knowledge and have some friendly competition. You can use a trivia bot like <a href="https://triviabot.co.uk/" target="_blank">TriviaBot</a> to create custom trivia questions or use pre-made question packs. You can organize tournaments with different themes or categories and give out prizes to the winners. You can also host trivia nights where everyone can join in and answer questions together. Award points to participants and crown the ultimate trivia champion.

## 3. Art Showcase

Encourage creativity by hosting art showcases where community members can share their game-related artwork. Create a dedicated channel where participants can showcase their creations and allow others to provide feedback and appreciation. You can also organise art contests with specific themes or prompts and award prizes to the winners. Art showcases are a great way to celebrate the talent and creativity of your community members.

## 4. Finish My Art

Host a "Finish My Art" event where every member of your community can add their own unique touch to an unfinished piece of art you provide. Start by sharing a base image or sketch and invite others to add their own touches and ideas. You can create a dedicated channel for the event where participants can share their progress and collaborate with others. Finish My Art events are a fun way to bring the community together and create unique collaborative artwork. This is something I have personally done on a public Discord server and it was a huge success!

## 5. Movie Nights

Host movie nights where community members can watch movies together in a voice channel. You can use streaming services like <a href="https://www.netflix.com/" target="_blank">Netflix</a> or <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/" target="_blank">Disney+</a> to stream movies and share your screen with others. You can choose a theme or genre for each movie night and let the community vote on which movie to watch. A few streaming services have watch party features built in, so you can easily sync up your viewing experience with others.

## 6. Karaoke Nights

Find a hidden superstar amongst your community members. Just set up a voice channel where participants can take turns singing their favourite songs or tracks. Foster a supportive and fun environment to encourage participation. Karaoke nights are a great way to showcase talent and have a good time with your community.

## 7. Watch Parties

Similar to movie nights, you can host watch parties for TV shows, anime, or web series. Create a dedicated channel where community members can discuss the show, share their thoughts, and react to key moments. You can use the Discord Youtube integration to stream episodes or use a screen sharing feature to [watch together](https://w2g.tv/en/). Watch parties are a great way to bond over shared interests and create a sense of community.

## 8. Discord Talent Show

A talent show is a fun way to showcase the different talents of your community members. Invite participants to share their talents, whether it's singing, dancing, playing an instrument, comedy or any other skill. Create a dedicated voice channel where participants can perform live or share a pre-recorded show. You can also invite judges or let the community vote on the best performances. Award prizes to the winners and praise the next big talents of your community.

## 9. Giveaways

Giveaways are a great way to give back to your community and reward your members for their support. You can host regular giveaways with prizes like Discord Nitro, game keys, gift cards, or custom roles. Create a dedicated channel for giveaways where members can participate and follow the rules to enter. You can use a giveaway bot like <a href="https://giveaway.boats/" target="_blank">GiveawayBot</a> to manage entries and select winners randomly. Giveaways are a great way to boost engagement and give back to your community.

## 10. Community Challenges

A community challenge is a fun way to encourage participation and collaboration within your community and create new groups of friends. You can create challenges such as art prompts, writing contests, or gaming tournaments and invite members to participate. Set a deadline for submissions and award prizes to the winners. Community challenges are a great way to encourage creativity, teamwork and engagement within your community. 

Here are 10 easy and fun Discord event ideas to help you engage with your community and create memorable experiences. Whether you want to host game nights, trivia tournaments or art exhibitions, there's something for everyone. Get creative and have fun with your community events!
